###### Goal:

To study Bayesian approaches to regression.

###### Approach:

Posterior = (prior x likelihood)/ Marginal likelihood

###### Observation:

This is used as it’s much more straightforward to model the likelihood and prior terms (i.e., using Bayes’ rule) than to model the posterior directly. Here straightforward means modelling convenience and also mathematical tractability.
